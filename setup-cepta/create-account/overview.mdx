You can create a Cepta account to get started with using our API. When you create an account, you will be required to complete your onboarding process for the user type you have selected. There are two user types that we supported. 
Cepta allows you to select any of these user types before account creation. Once all of this is completed, you can begin to use all of the features available to you. You can collaborate by exploring the team option, which allows you to add team members to your workspace. 

### Cepta user types

1. Aggregators

2. Merchants
