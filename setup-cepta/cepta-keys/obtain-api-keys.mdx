## API Keys

<Warning>
  Your API secret is used as secure access to authenticate with Cepta, failure to protect it might lead to unauthorized access to your project. 
</Warning>

We provide a test API key for development and a live API key for production. To get any of the keys after setting up an account, navigate to your **dashboard** > **settings** > **API Credentials** page. 

<Frame caption="Test Credentials">
  <img src="/images/cred-image.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} loading="lazy" />
</Frame>

Copy the key and ensure you protect it by using it as an `environment variable` 

## Platform webhook URL and callback URL
Aside from getting your API keys on this page, there is also a live and development empty box for setting a callback URL and a webhook URL. 

To set a callback URL, you can choose to set it from here or pass it as part of your request body when you initialize a payment.

<Frame caption="Callback URL">
  <img src="/images/image-back.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} loading="lazy" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  When you initialize a payment and you didn't pass a callback URL, our system defaults to the one set on your dashboard. If nothing is there, we will prompt you to add a callback URL.
