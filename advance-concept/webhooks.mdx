## Overview

A webhook is an event-driven communication system that allows one system to send real-time data to another system via HTTP when a specific event occurs.

<Info>
  When a transaction happens on your system, be it card, USSD or payout. Your system will not be aware of this. However, when you set up a webhook, we will notify you of the type of event and the status.
</Info>

# How It works
 
1. **Set up a URL**: First, you create a special URL on your server so that Cepta can send a `POST` request of transaction status. 
2. **Payment Event Trigger**: When a payment event happens, Cepta will automatically "call" your URL to notify your system of the event.
3. **Your System Responds**: Your server receives the webhook, processes the information , and sends back a simple acknowledgment like a `200 OK` to let us know that the data was received successfully.

<Note>
  It's important that you query transaction status before you give value to your customer.
</Note>

## Set up a URL

To set a webhook URL, head over to your Cepta dashboard > **Settings** > **API Credentials**. Add your URL and click Set URLs.

## Validate Event Source
To ensure the webhook events are coming from us, we will send a signature hash as part of the  `header`, this hash will come in this format `` you will have to validate it before making use of the response data.

<Warning>   
  Always validate the signature hash before proceeding with business logic.
</Warning>


## Payment Event Trigger

When a transaction happens, we will send information regarding this transaction to your system via a dedicated URL that you have created. Below is a list of event types that we supported.

### Supported Webhook Event Types

| Event Types                                | Description                                        |
| -------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `card.collection.status`                   |  Event triggered when a card transaction occurred  |
| `bank.transfer.collection.status`          |  Event triggered when a bank transfer transaction occurred  |
| `ussd.collection.status`                   |  Event triggered when a USSD transaction occurred  |

### Event types structure

The data we send across to you for all event type are of similar structure, only the  `eventType` and the `data` object will varies based on what type of event information we send.

### Best Practices

**1.Ensure Secure URLs**: Use HTTPS for your webhook URL to ensure the communication between systems is encrypted and secure.

**2.Validate Webhook Signatures**: Always validate the signature hash from the request header to confirm that the webhook is genuinely coming from Cepta and not from a malicious third party.

**3.Check Event Data Before Processing**: Before using the event data in your business logic, verify that the status is successful to avoid processing failed transactions.

**4.Avoid Re-Processing**: If your system has already processed a webhook event, ensure you don't reprocess the same event. This can be done by checking the transaction reference or using idempotency keys.

**5.Handle Failures Gracefully**: If your server doesn't respond with `200 OK`, Cepta will retry the webhook a few times. Make sure your server handles these retries gracefully.

**6.Monitor Webhook Deliveries**: Set up logging to monitor the incoming webhook requests and responses. This helps to identify and debug issues quickly.

**7.Respond Quickly**: Send a response as soon as possible (ideally within a few milliseconds) to acknowledge receipt of the webhook. If processing the data takes longer, do it asynchronously.

**8.Ensure Idempotency**: Your webhook endpoint should handle duplicate notifications without adverse effects. This is especially important in case of retries.

**9.Test Webhooks**: Before going live, use sandbox or test environments to verify that your webhook integration is correctly processing the events.
