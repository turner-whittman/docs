## SSL and HTTPS 
### Secure Sockets Layer
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is an encryption-based security protocol developed by Netscape to protect data and ensure authentication during transmission over the internet. It encrypts the data exchanged between the user’s device and the server, safeguarding it from potential interception or tampering, and thereby ensuring data security.

SSL also performs a handshake process between the client and the server. During this handshake, the server provides a digital certificate that the client verifies, typically with the help of a trusted certificate authority (CA). This verification confirms that the server is authentic and the user is communicating with the intended entity, providing a layer of authentication and protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks.

### HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
HTTPS is a secure version of the standard web protocol, HTTP, that uses encryption to protect data shared between your device and a website. It ensures that sensitive information, like passwords and payment details, stays private and safe from hackers. HTTPS also verifies that the website you're communicating with is legitimate, using a digital certificate trusted by a Certificate Authority (CA). This helps prevent impersonation and ensures the data isn't altered during transmission. In short, HTTPS keeps your online activities secure, making it a must for any site handling sensitive information.

## Secured card communicating with AES
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a popular encryption method used to keep data safe. It works by scrambling data with a secret key so that only person with the right key can unscramble and read it. AES is fast, secure, and widely used to protect sensitive information like credit card details, personal messages, and even government communications. It can use different key sizes (128, 192, or 256 bits), with longer keys offering stronger protection. Because it’s both secure and efficient, AES is the go-to encryption method for protecting data in many industries, from banking to healthcare.

## Tokens Are Used as Means for Authentication

We used tokens as a secure way to communicate with Cepta when integrating; tokens are useful because even if someone intercepts the token, it cannot be used to access sensitive data since it's meaningless on its own. This enhances security by minimizing the risk of data breaches and fraud, as the original information is never stored or transmitted. Tokens are commonly used in situations like single sign-on (SSO), payment processing, and mobile apps to make authentication safer and more secure.
