## overview

To authenticate API requests, you must include a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header of your requests. You can obtain this token from your [Dashboard](https://qa.cepta.co/settings/api-credentials) once you’ve created your account and logged in.

Here’s an example of how to include the Bearer token in your API requests:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.cepta.co/endpoint \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"
```

<Warning>
  **Always protect your secret keys**
  These keys grant access to your project and its associated resources, so they should never be shared or exposed in public repositories. Treat your keys as sensitive information to avoid unauthorized access to your account.
