Welcome to the **Cepta Quickstart**! This guide will help you get started with **Cepta** in just a few simple steps. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate our API or a merchant using our platform, you'll be up and running in no time.

Before you can start using Cepta, you need to create an account. Follow these simple steps to set up your account:

## Let's get you set up

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Creata Account"
    icon="plus"
    href="/product/merchant/create-payment"
  >
    Create an account to get started
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Get API keys"
    icon="key"
    href="/product/merchant/verify-payment"
  >
    Get your secret keys to start using our API 
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Initialize a transaction using checkout.
Initialize a transaction link endpoint by making an API call to this endpoint. [Learn more]('/product/accept-payment') about how the accept payment API works.
```bash Request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://dev-adapter.cepta.co/api/v1/pay \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '
    {
        "amount": 100,
        "currency": "NGN",
        "description": "Purchase of goods",
