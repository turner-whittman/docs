To get started with the purchase API, you can initialize the transaction just like the example request described above. You will be required to pass in some parameters as part of the request. `Amount`, `transactionRef`, `currency`, and `callbackUrl` are some of the required parameters accepted. When a transaction is initialized and processed, ideally you want to redirect customers based on the status of the payment. The `callbackUrl` passed will be used for this purpose.

You can choose to pass your `callbackUrl` as a request parameter here or set it from within your Cepta dashboard [settings page](https://dev.twpay.io/settings/api-credentials). We allow you to set test and production `callbackUrl`, to learn more [check here](www.f).

<Note>
   Ensure transactionRef is unique for every transaction. Unique references are crucial for reconciling transactions with bank statements or payment processors.

<Note> 
   Device information is important for 3D Secure verification   
</Note>

Implementing 3D Secure verification helps us to verify that the transaction is being made by the rightful customer, adding an extra layer of security. This information includes details about the customer's browser and device, such as whether JavaScript is enabled or the screen size.

If the 3D Secure authentication URL `threedSecureUrl` is provided, it should be shown to the customer, directing them to a secure page where they can complete the verification process. This ensures the payment is legitimate and helps prevent fraud.
