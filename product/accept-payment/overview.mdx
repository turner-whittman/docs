The initialize transaction endpoint allows merchants to securely initiate a payment; when they do this, a redirect link is returned to complete this transaction. This is an essential feature for businesses that need to accept online payment. The payment link created when a transaction is initiated is customized with transaction details such as the payment amount and the customer's email, making it easy for businesses to request payments.

This feature is ideal for merchants who want to simplify their payment process, whether they are selling products, services, or subscriptions. By generating a payment link, businesses can easily share it with customers via email, SMS, or social media, allowing for a smooth and secure payment experience.
