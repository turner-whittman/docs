## Transaction statuses

When verifying a transaction status, we have a defined status type that you can expect to see here.

|  Transaction Status Type  | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pending`                 | The transaction is awaiting processing or validation. This could indicate invalid request parameters or that the transaction is in a holding state.             |
| `successful`              | The transaction was successfully processed, The payment has been completed without issues.                                                                      |
| `failed`                  | The transaction encountered an error during processing, possibly due to insufficient funds, incorrect details, or a technical failure.                          |
| `reversed`                | The transaction was reversed due to an error, which could include issues like a duplicate payment, invalid card details, or a technical failure in processing.  |
