The Create Payment endpoint allows merchants to create a payment link, which customers can use to complete their transactions securely. This is an essential feature for businesses that need to accept online payments without the need for a complex integration process. The payment link is customized with transaction details such as the payment amount, description, and the customer's email, making it easy for businesses to request payments.

This feature is ideal for merchants who want to simplify their payment process, whether they are selling products, services, or subscriptions. By generating a payment link, businesses can easily share it with customers via email, SMS, or social media, allowing for a smooth and secure payment experience.
